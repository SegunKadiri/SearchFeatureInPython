# SearchFeatureInPython
This project aims to implement a search feature in Python based on a Business requirement. It would be continuously improved based performance, scalability e.t.c. In the mean time this is a prototype and working version of the first sprint of the full project. In this Sprint, the problem definition is this :

Write a script that would initially take in a list of magazine names from a file, and then write a function that uses the user’s search input to return up to 3 alphabetically sorted choices from that list. 
 
For example: If the user types “ma” we should return: 
- Mademoiselle Blok 
- Magicmaman Famili 
- Marianne 
 
If the user types “der”: 
- Derby Tiercé 
 
If the user types “gard” we return nothing 

The data source and implementation are included in this repositiory. The upcoming modules and improvements or future sprints are included as issues to be resolved.
